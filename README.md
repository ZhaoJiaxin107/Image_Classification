# Image_Recognition
Basic image recognition project to deep learning

### Data acquisition and use

#### Data acquisition

· Common ways to get data
1. public dataset
   MINIST, ImageNet etc.
   
2. Self-built dataset
  Collection
  Reptile
  
 #### MINIST(fundamentals for deep learning)
 It includes 60000 pictures and 10 types of numbers
 
 MNIST color enhancement
 · CIFAR10, 60,000 pictures and 10 kinds of objects
 · CIFAR100, 60,000 picture and 10 kinds of objects with more diversity and fine-grained classification
 
#### The PASCAL Visual Object
It contains 5 competitions: classification/detection/segmentation/action classificstion and person layout

#### imageNet
140,000,000 pictures and 20,000 classifications, millions of comments

What's more, we could also build dataset by ourselves.


#### Microsoft coco
328,000 pictures and 2,500,000 labels
Richer foreground, background and finer annotation

#### 1.Camera Collection
#### 2.Data crowdsourcing（数据众包）

Both of two approaches cost a lot.

#### 3.Reptile
Picture crawler & Video crawler

##### Image Downloader(Picture crawler)

search the keyword like "嘟嘴"

##### Annie(Video crawler)
